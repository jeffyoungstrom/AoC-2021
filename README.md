# AoC-2021
My attempt at solving the 2021 Advent of Code puzzles in Python

I don't identify as a programmer despite having a (very old) CS degree.

I wrote in Perl for many years and it probably shows. Relatively new to Python.

Constructive criticism gladly entertained.

This is a learning/practice exercise for me so you don't want to use any of this!
